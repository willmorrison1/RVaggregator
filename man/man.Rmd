## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

setwd("C:/Users/willm/Documents/GitHub/RVaggregator/")


library(RVaggregator)


RVaggregator(input_file = "data/sample/sample_input_raster_ordinal.tif",
             aggregation_file = "data/sample/sample_shapefile/sample_shapefile.shp",
             aggregation_type = "fraction",
             output_directory = "data/sample/output",
             poly_chunk_size = 5)
```
